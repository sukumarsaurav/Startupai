# FAQ Section Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to add the FAQ section to any service page on the StartupAI website.

## Prerequisites

Make sure these files already exist in your project:
- `assets/css/faq.css` - Contains the styling for the FAQ section
- `assets/js/faq.js` - Contains the JavaScript functionality for the FAQ section

## Step 1: Add Required CSS and JS References

Add the following lines to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

```html
<!-- FAQ CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../assets/css/faq.css">
```

Add the following lines just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<!-- FAQ JS -->
<script src="../../../assets/js/faq.js"></script>
```

## Step 2: Copy the FAQ Template

Copy the FAQ section template from `assets/templates/faq-section-template.html`.

## Step 3: Insert the FAQ Section

Paste the template code before the footer and after the CTA section in your service page.

## Step 4: Customize the Content

1. Replace `[SERVICE_NAME]` with the name of your service (e.g., "SEO", "React Development", etc.)
2. Replace `[QUESTION_1]` through `[QUESTION_8]` with relevant questions for your service
3. Replace `[ANSWER_1]` through `[ANSWER_8]` with detailed answers for each question
